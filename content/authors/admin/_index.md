I am Jiao Yu. I am currently an postdoctoral associate at the University of Minnesota, [Minnesota Population Center](https://pop.umn.edu/). My research focuses on examining the **social determinants of health** over the life course, with a particular interest in the intersection of environment, aging, life course, and health disparities. My current research investigates  how reproductive history patterns shape later life health outcomes and  how bio-physiological and contextual factors affect old age health disparities. I utilize contemporary statistical methods — particularly **longitudinal trajectory models** and **sequence analysis** to draw inferences from nationally representative longitudinal surveys — in my research.

Additionally, I worked with the [IPUMS PMA](https://pma.ipums.org/pma/)  team to study environmental impacts on women's health and contribute to the [IPUMS PMA Data Analysis Hub](https://tech.popdata.org/pma-data-hub/), which provides hands-on R tutorials on data visualization and analysis.
