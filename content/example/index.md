Welcome to my Data Science with Python course!

You can find all the Jupyter notebook on my Github page [here](https://github.com/JYU-412/Machine-Learning).



## Course Objectives 

This class aims to provide social science students with a better understanding of the theoretical concepts of machine learning technique,  and also the practical implementations of these methods to answer questions in the real world. The class will cover topics in regression, classification, ensemble methods, clustering, neural networks, etc. Students will also gain hands-on skills in software implement with r or python. 

For the class format, concepts will be first introduced through assigned readings and short videos.  In in-class sessions, I will help students summarize major ideas and put key concepts into practice. Lab session and homework will be provided to help students practice and sharp their coding skills. I hope  this course can lay a foundation for students who interested in machine learning techniques.
