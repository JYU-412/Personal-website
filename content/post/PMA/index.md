IPUMS PMA harmonizes the [Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA)](https://www.pmadata.org/) data series. It provides an interactive web dissemination system for PMA data with variable documentation on thousands of harmonized variables on family planning, maternal, and child health.  The IPUMS PMA [Data Analysis Hub](https://ipums.github.io/pma-data-hub/) is a blog offering tutorials of R codes for working with IPUMS PMA data. This blogpost demonstrates how to use multilevel models to examine factors related to womenâ€™s satisfaction with family planning care received from the service delivery facilities in Kenya.
