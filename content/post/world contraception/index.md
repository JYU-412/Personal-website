This project is a demonstration of how to use python for data visualization. Modules used for this project includes pandas, numpy, fuzzywuzzy for data cleaning; geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh for plotting. I intend to examine what is the most commonly used contraceptive method worldwide, especially contraceptive use in the United States.
