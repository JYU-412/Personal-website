 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the effect of zinc supplementation on markers of inflammation and monocyte activation in antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV infection. METHODS: This is a phase I open-labeled randomized double-arm study, exploring the efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation on inflammation in ≥18-year-old people living with HIV in the US, on stable antiretroviral therapy and with zinc levels ≤75 µg/dL in the last 60 days. Patients were randomized 1:1 to zinc gluconate capsules at a dose of 45 mg (low-dose), or 90 mg (high-dose) elemental zinc daily for 16 weeks. We assessed inflammatory and gut integrity biomarkers at baseline and 16 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 52 participants were enrolled (25 participants in the low-dose arm and 27 participants in the high-dose arm). Median (Interquartile range) age was 49 (38, 60) years, 77% were men and 73% were African Americans. At baseline, median zinc levels were 73 (64, 86) µg/dL. Median circulating zinc levels increased to 91 µg/dL in the low-dose arm and to 100 µg/dL in the high-dose arm. Overall, 48%-60% of participants experienced a reduction in biomarkers levels. The margin of reduction ranged between 8% and 21%. This change was meaningful with large effect size (Cohen D ranging from 5 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we found that zinc supplementation is effective at increasing circulating zinc levels. In addition, our findings provide novel data suggesting that zinc can affect a biological signature in people living with HIV and modulate biomarkers associated with clinical comorbidities.},
