We will gain experience in formulating a research question, developing a research design, generating and analyzing data, and presenting your results. Successful completion of this course will help students to make linkages between empirical data and theoretical concepts and develop appropriate research designs and instruments to answer sociological questions.

# Course Objectives 
After completing this course, students will be able to:
-	Identify the fundamental theoretical and methodological differences between quantitative and qualitative research designs.
-	Develop research questions and select appropriate research methods to address them.
-	Evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different research designs.
-	Articulate the ethical and political issues surrounding social science research.
-	Use theoretically informed social research methods as tools for future research. 
-	Analyze quantitative data using basic statistics and statistical software. 
-	Develop and defend a research proposal.
